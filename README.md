#2D Game Engine test

* 2D tilemap

* Tick/turn-based time progression, probably swappable to a realtime system instead

* Level generation (spanning tree based for rooms, possibly more types later?)

* Yet another usecase for that amazing GUI library I am writing (which is TOTALLY almost ready to be a standalone)

* I made all of the "art" for it, so it is good spriting practice
